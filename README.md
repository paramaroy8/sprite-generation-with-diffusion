## Project Description

In this project, sprite images are generated using diffusion model.

## Why Sprite Images Instead Of Real-life Images?

Sprite images have reduced complexities compared to real-life images. As a result, this dataset is a less computationally expensive, making it a efficient for fast experimentation with different types of models and techniques.
